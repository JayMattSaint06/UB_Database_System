In this project, I'm taking a look at my school (University at Buffalo)'s database system and attempting to create a very oversimplified version of it. 

Planning on doing things such as creating new students, having them do actions with their accounts (such as load money into their account balance via a seperate bank class, buy items/food from school, apply to classes, switch majors, etc.)
